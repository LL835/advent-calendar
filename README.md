# Advent Calendar
## Overview

An advent calendar with videos and gifs hiding behind each tile.
## How it works

This app has the following features:

- The date input allows a user to choose a day in December.
- There are 25 tiles. Behind each is a video or gif that can only be seen after the user has revealed the tile.
- The user can only reveal the content behind the tile if the date they clicked on is earlier than or the same as the date in the date input.
- Progress is saved in local storage so users can come back to the calendar each day to reveal the next tile.
